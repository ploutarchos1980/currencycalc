## Prepare for Windows Installation

#### Basic configuration of Apache2.

You need to configure the Virtual Host to work properly for the project.

Here are the steps to do this:

- First open in an editor the file "C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf" 

- Next place the following code (copy/paste)

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    # This domain just for reference.
    ServerName currencycalc.tld
    ServerAlias www.currencycalc.tld

    DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/currencycalc/public"
    DirectoryIndex "/index.php"

    <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/currencycalc/public">
        AllowOverride None
        Order Allow,Deny
        Allow from All

        FallbackResource /index.php
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog "logs/currencycalc_error.log"
    CustomLog "logs/currencycalc_access.log" common
</VirtualHost>
```

### Clone - Download the project 

Go to your document root of your server (in the above case inside the folder "C:/xampp/htdocs/") and excecute the below command.

```
git clone https://github.com/ploutarchos1980/currencycalc.git
```

## Compile and run the project

After downloading the project locally or using git, enter the folder you created and follow the instructions below to compile and run the project.

#### Composer much be installed first.

```bash
$ composer install 
```

#### Second you need to install npm.

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### Building the project
```bash
$ npm run dev 
```

Restart the Apache Server and then visit the web location "http://locahost"

**That was it. Congratulation!**

If everything went OK, you should be able to see the main page as well.

### Symfony CLI mode

You can also run the project with Symfony CLI if it is already installed. 

RunÂ inside the folder of the project the following command:
```bash
$ symfony serve 
```

## Linux users

For Linux users, you must have installed the same software as well:

**PHP 8.1, Apache 2, SQLite PHP, Composer, NodeJS, and Git to make the project run correctly.**

The configuration of Apache2 is almost the same and the clonning part and compilation are the same as mentioned before.

#### Furthermore, about installation and configuration you can read the following documentations.

[Installation guide](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html)

[Download Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download)
 

**More about Server Installation**

If you don't have Symfony CLI installed, then follow the instructions below to run the project with Ngix or Apache2 according to your system and your needs.

[Apache2 & Ngix configuration](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html)
